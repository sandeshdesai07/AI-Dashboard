ü§ñ AI Tools Used

üîß Primary Tools
Streamlit ‚Äì For building the interactive web-based data analytics dashboard.
ChatGPT (OpenAI) ‚Äì Assisted in writing Python logic, refining UI design, improving interactivity, and debugging.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üìå Key Use Cases
Plot Logic Automation: Auto-generated visualizations based on user-selected plot types and column types.
UI Enhancements: Styled the dashboard with hover effects, gradients, and animations using HTML/CSS embedded in Streamlit with guidance from AI.
Code Optimization: Rewrote or optimized several blocks of code using AI suggestions to make the app more efficient and readable.

üß† Sample Prompts Used
"Generate a Streamlit component with hover effects and centered gradient title banner."
"How to persist uploaded files across Streamlit multi-page navigation?"
"Add download link for matplotlib plots in Streamlit as PNG."
"Generate HTML and CSS to center a heading inside a rounded rectangle box."
"Improve visual appeal of sidebar options with gradient buttons and animations."
"Build a function to handle corrupted CSV file encodings while reading with pandas."
"Give a summary of the first 10 rows of a dataset using a language model."
"Write code for a violin plot using seaborn and integrate it into a Streamlit selectbox."

Manual Coding 
UI Customization with CSS
- Designed and implemented custom UI elements using inline HTML and CSS injected via st.markdown().
- Rounded corners and soft box shadows for cards and buttons
- Hover effects using :hover pseudo-class with smooth transitions
- Animated scaling on hover for interactivity

State Management
- Used st.session_state to persist uploaded data across multiple pages without requiring repeated uploads.

Data Preprocessing
- Handled encoding errors, identified numeric/categorical columns, and computed summaries like null counts and descriptive statistics using pandas.

Downloadable Visuals
- Implemented a BytesIO + base64 method to enable one-click downloads of generated plots in PNG format.

Error Handling and UX Enhancements
- Added real-time feedback for data loading, errors, and user tips, ensuring smooth navigation and usage across app pages

- Integrating AI-generated code with proper layout
- Final UI tweaks and debugging

Customization

üñåÔ∏è Advanced UI Styling
- Gradient Headers: Created visually appealing title bars with CSS gradients, rounded corners, shadows, and scaling hover animations.
- Themed Sidebar Elements: Styled the sidebar title (st.sidebar.markdown) with a responsive background gradient and subtle box-shadow to highlight the options panel.
- Custom Selectbox Label: Wrapped select boxes with floating gradient labels that respond to hover with scale and shadow transitions.
- Data Visual Panel: Used pastel tones, bold left borders, and modern typography for section headers like Auto Plots, matching modern dashboard themes.
- Hover Effects: Every major visual block (titles, panels, cards) includes interactive :hover styling using CSS transition and transform to increase engagement.

üß± Layout & Component Structuring
- Grid-Style Containers: Used st.container() and consistent margin/padding strategy to align UI elements like a dashboard layout.
- Centered Visual Hierarchy: Central alignment of key headings and consistent spacing ensures that the user‚Äôs focus is naturally guided across the page.
- Expandable Sections: Used st.expander() effectively to allow collapsible panels (e.g., for stats, missing data) while keeping the interface clean and uncluttered.
- Visual Consistency: Typography and color palettes are aligned throughout the app for a cohesive look.

‚úÖ Code Quality and Readability
- Separation of Concerns: Logical blocks are cleanly separated (title, file upload, data preview, plot logic) for clarity and future reusability.
- Commented & Documented: Each code block includes inline comments and section headers using triple hashtags ### to improve navigation and collaboration.
- Reusable Components: Download button generator (generate_download_link) is modular, enabling consistent export UX across plots.
- Adapted AI suggestions to match personal styling preferences and page flow
- Rewrote layout to match desired visual hierarchy
- Modified AI-generated CSS to ensure responsiveness and minimal clutter
